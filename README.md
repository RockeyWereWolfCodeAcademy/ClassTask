# C# "Class" Named Task

## Task Description:

You define a User class with Username and Password fields, Login and Logout methods. If the login method is called for the first time for the object, then it should be written "the user has logged into the account". If the user is logged in, then print the message "the user has entered the account in advance" on the screen. If the user has a login, when calling the Logout method, it should say "the user has logged out". If the user does not have a login, then "the user does not log in to the account".
